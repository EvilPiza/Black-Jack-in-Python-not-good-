This is pretty self explanatory, I made Black Jack in python for a project, it's not great but it's not THAT bad.

Controls:
(For Modes Only)
"normal" or "n" for Normal Bot Luck
"lucky" or "l" for Lucky Bot Luck 
"insane" or "i" for Insane Bot Luck
if you put something other than listed above it will just select default, which is Normal bot luck.

(In Game Only)
"hit" or "h" to hit
"stay" or "s" to stay 

(IMPORTANT) 
it's that simple, also make sure it's all lowercase i'm not cool enough to accept caps.
